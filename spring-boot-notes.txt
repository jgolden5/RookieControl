Bean Flow:
HTTP Client 
  ↓ (JSON payload)
@RestController 
  ↓ (@RequestBody → automatically binds + validates → creates Request DTO instance)
@Service (receives Request DTO → maps to entity → applies business logic)
  ↓
@Repository (persists/updates entity in DB)
  ↓ (returns saved/updated entity)
@Service (receives entity → maps to Response DTO)
  ↓ (returns Response DTO)
@RestController (receives Response DTO → wraps in ResponseEntity if needed)
  ↓ (Spring Boot's "Jackson" tool automatically serializes Response DTO to JSON)
HTTP Client

Oneline version:
